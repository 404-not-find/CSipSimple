For any question on how to build PLEASE join the development group Also, if you build CSipSimple, you should first read the Licensing wiki page<br>

Introduction
==========
The application has two distinct parts : * The pjsip dynamic library part that produce a .so (to be more precise a .so by android target). * The java application that produce a .apk (and can be installed on your android device).<br><br>
If you are a java developer and you are not interested in building the sip stack, there is an alternate - not easy to maintain - way to build by getting auto-generated swig java class and the dynamic library from nightly build website. Please search the dev google group to get info about this method that is not recommended.<br><br>
Some very important note : CSipSimple is released under GPL license. Be really aware about what does that mean before developing. Read Licensing wiki page.<br><br>
So if you plan to improve CSipSimple and redistribute it, you MUST release your source code. As we (CSipSimple developers) are open to any contribution, I'd advise you to directly contribute the CSipSimple project. All contributions are welcome !!!<br><br>
